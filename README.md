# Interdisciplinary Project SS2025: Techniques for Dynamic Visualization of Time-Varying Flood Data

Supervisors: Thais Beham, Martin Schobben

Students:
 Jakob Nicko, Jonas Schindler, Adam Domoslawski


 ## Project Goal
 Propose new ways and improvements for visualizing time-dependent flood data. We will work with the [Global Flood Monitoring dataset](https://www.tuwien.at/en/mg/geo/rs/open-data/gfm).

 Research questions:

 * How to combine flood likehood and flood extention in one visualization?
 * How to visualize the flood uncertainty?
 * How to better visuliaze dynamic flood events to facilitate decision-makers to promptly take actions based on the results? 
 * How to optimize performance to allow real-time analysis?
